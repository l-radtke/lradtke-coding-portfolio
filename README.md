I wasn't able to access the code I had saved on my Bridge:UP computer seeing as I didn't bring it with me while I was travelling, so I did the best I could with the files that I could acess online. If needed, I can provide my other code in several weeks when I'm back in New York. 
Thank you for understanding.
