		<section class = "HDI">
			<ul>HDI
				<li>created by the UN to measure the level of development of every country</li>
				<li>it's been around since 1990</li>
				<li>highest HDI possible is 1.0</li>
				<li>based on three factors <ul><li>standard of living</li><li>access to knowledge</li><li>long and healthy life</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<ul>The UN has divided the world into nine regions, each with its own overall HDI, here they are in order from highest to lowest HDI:
				<li>North America</li>
				<li>Europe</li>
				<li>Latin America</li>
				<li>East Asia</li>
				<li>Southwest asia and North Africa</li>
				<li>Southeast Asia</li>
				<li>Central Asia</li>
				<li>South Asia</li>
				<li>Sub-Saharan Africa</li>
			</ul>

			<br></br>
			<div class = "economic">

				<h3>Standard of living</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>GNI = gross national income = the value of the output of goods and services provided in a country in one year (including money that leaves and enters a country) </li>
					<li>GNI per capita = GNI divided by the total population</li>
					<li>GNI is not a perfect way to measure a country's standard of living because outliers can greatly sway the mean contribution</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>Jobs can be defined as being in the:
					<li>primary sector</li>
					<li>secondary sector</li>
					<li>tertiary sector</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>cottage industry is home based manufacturing</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>Workers in developed countries are more productive than those in developing countries because:
					<li>they have access to better machines, tools and equipment</li>
					<li>they receive better, more specialized educations with enable them to get higher paying jobs</li>
				</ul>

			</div>

			<br></br>

			<div class = "education">
				<h3>Access to knowledge</h3>
			
				<ul>Indicators to measure access to knowledge:
					<li>years of schooling for adults = time 25 year olds have spent in school</li>
					<li>years of schooling for today's youth = expected time 5 year olds will spend in school</li>
						<ul><li>The UN considers years of schooling to be the most critical measure of the ability of an individual to gain access to knowledge</li></ul>
					<li>pupil/teacher ratio = number of enrolled students divided by the number of teachers</li>
					<li>literacy rate = percentage of a population who can read and write</li>
				</ul>

			</div>

			<br></br>
			<div class = "health">
				<h3>Health and longevity</h3>
			
				<ul>
					<li>life expectancy = average number of years a newborn infant can expect to live at current mortality levels</li>
					<li>worldwide average is 71 years</li>
						<ul>
							<li>80 years in developed countries</li>
							<li>57 years in Sub-Saharan Africa</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

				<ul>People in developed coutnries are healthier because:
					<li>more resources to cure the sick</li>
					<li>wealth to protect those unable to work</li>
					<li>public assistance for 
						<ul> <li>sick</li>
							<li>poor</li>
							<li>disabled</li>
							<li>orphans</li>
							<li>veterans of war</li>
							<li>widows</li>
							<li>unemployed</li>
							<li>single parents</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>better healthcare and welfare</li>
					<li>HOWEVER: longer life exoectancy leads to an older population and greater strain on governments and working citizens to support the dependent</li>
				</ul>

				<br></br>
				<ul>Trends in HDI factors since 1980:
					<li>HDI: the gap between developed and developing coubtries is narrowing, the HDI is increasing rapidly in developing regions</li>
					<li>GNI per capita: increasing more rapidly in developed in developed countries <- problem because of increasing inequality</li>
					<li>Education: around the same increase in both</li>
					<li>Life expectancy: around the same increase in both</li>
				</ul>

				<ul class = "malala">Malala Yousafzai:
					<li>shot in the head in 2012 when she was trying to go to school</li>
					<li>speaks for those without voice</li>
					<li>wants wants education for every child</li>
					<li>mentions child labor in India and the destruction of school in Nigeria</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class = "equality">

				<br></br>

				<h3>Equality</h3>

				<ul>Gender inequality index (GII):

					<li>Reproductive health: 
						<ul>
							<li>Maternal mortality rates (MMR):<ul>
								<li>In developed countries, 16/100K births</li>
								<li>In developing countries, 171/100K births</li></ul>
							</li>
							<li>Adolescent fertility rate</li>
							<li>Lower birth rates lead to better health</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>Female empowerment
						<ul>
						<li>Parliamentary seats held by women</li>
						<li>Enrollment in higher education</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>Labor force participation (women divided by men)</li>

					<li>The highest GIIs are in developing countries (Sub-Saharn Africa, South Asia, Central Asia, Southwest Asia, North Africa)</li>

				</ul>

				<ul>

					<li>Empowerment is the ability of women to achieve improvements in their own status/ achieve economic and political power</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Percentage of seats held by women in the national legislature</li>
						<ul>
							<li>North America, Western Europe, Northern Europe, South Africa, Australia, and Southwest America have the highest percentage of women in their national legislatures (above 20%)</li>
							<li>The US has 10-19%</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Percentage of women who have compleeted some secondary school </li>
					</ul>

					<li>Female labor force participation rate is the percentage of women holding full-time jobs outside the home (worldwide average is 51%)</li>

				</ul>

				<ul>Economic development

					<li>Self-sufficiency model: closed off from trade 
						<ul><li>Barriers limit the import of goods</li>
							<li>Fledgling businesses become isolated from competition</li>
							<li>Reducing poverty takes precedence</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>International trade approach
						<ul><li>Open to foreign investment and international markets</li>
							<li>Arabian countries, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>Since India dismantled its collection of barriers to international trade, its GNI per capita has increased and it has produced higher quality goods</li>

				</ul>

				<ul>World Trade Organization (WTO)
					<li>Formed by countries that conduct the majority of international trade (97% of it)</li>
					<li>Seeks to reduce barriers to international trade</li>
					<li>Seeks to protect intellectual property especially in the age of the Internet</li>
					<li>Critics: 
						<ul><li>Progressives claim that the WTO is antidemocratic as decisions made in secret promote the interests of large corporations rather than the poor</li>
							<li>Conservatives claim that WTO compromises power and sovereignty of individual countries because it [the WTO] can order changes and laws that they consider unfair trading practices</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Other global banks/funds
						<ul><li>World Bank(IBRD, IDA)</li>
							<li>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>Economic downturns
					<li>1: stimulus strategy - governments spend more money - ex US 2008</li>
					<li>2: austerity strategy - governments reduce taxes so people spend more</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an investment made by a foreign company in the economy of another country</li>
					<li>Microfinance is a provision of small loans and other financial services to individuals and small businesses in developing countries</li>
					<li>Fair trade is international trade that provides greater equality to workers, small businesses, and consumers
						<ul><li>Fair trade for workers: child labor laws outlawed, unions</li>
							<li>Fair trade for consumers: people involved run the business, democratically governed by a member elected board rather than a corporate owner</li>
						</ul>
